        <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About the Developer</h2>
        <p>
          UV Control was built by <strong>Gonzalo Salas</strong>, a full-stack web developer based in Denmark with roots in Spain. With a background in media and a growing specialization in frontend/backend development, Gonzalo is passionate about building meaningful, accessible, and purpose-driven digital tools. This project is a blend of technical learning, public health advocacy, and creative vision.

          The app was born from a simple idea: empower people to protect their health while enjoying life under the sun. UV Control provides real-time UV forecasts, product suggestions, and scientific information to raise awareness about the risks of solar radiation.
